Radial Pulse –taking radial pulse on other arm simultaneously (student will time and must communicate start and stop. Counting starts at 1 for radial pulse)
o Assesses  radial pulse for at least 30sec  
o States regular/irregular correctly  
o Stated rate and must be within 2-4/bpm             	         


Apical Pulse - tester listening on dual stethoscope with student (student will time and must communicate start and stop – Counting starts at zero for apical pulse check)
o Assesses apical pulse at 5th intercostal, midclavicular line left must be under shirt- stethoscope to skin 
o Counted for one  full minute     
o States regular/irregular correctly

Respiratory Rate = inhale/exhale = 1    –assessing with student (student will time and must communicate for start and stop) 
o Assessed respiratory rate for at least 30 seconds       
o Results need to be within 2-3 respirations/minute of the evaluator.                

Pain Assessment - 
o Questions client about pain status (Give a pain amount to use for this assessment) 
o Teaches pain scale 0-10 correctly to actor (0 = no pain… 10 = worst pain ever)
o Verbalizes pain assessment using – PQRSTU 
o P  =  (what) Provokes  
o Q =  Quality (sharp, dull,stabbing,burning,,crushing,throbbing,)  
o R =  Radiation (does it go anywhere)  
o S =  Severity (pain scale – 0=10)  
o T =  Time  (when does it usually occur)   
U =  You  (how does it affect your life)
Blood Glucose Monitoring

o Check care provider’s orders for time and frequency of measurement
o Gather your supplies, glucometer, test strip, lancet, cotton ball or 2x2 gauze, alcohol swab, documentation form, gloves bleach wipe, 
o Use two patient identifiers to confirm the correct client
o Explain to the client that you are going to check his blood sugar and explain that you will be using a glucometer
o Perform hand hygiene and don gloves
o Inspect and select a site, for bruising and sensitivity. Place the hand in a dependent position. (May ask the patient which site he was last pricked to check his blood sugar

o Turn on the glucometer and insert the testing strip according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Confirm the code on the test strip matches the code on the glucometer’s screen.
o Clean the site chosen to perform the finger stick with an alcohol swab and allow to dry.
o Prepare the lancet, place it firmly against selected site and depress trigger.
o Wipe away the first drop of blood and place the second drop of blood against the receiving area of the test strip
o Document the result, time, date, client and room number

THE FOUR MAJOR TYPES OF PAIN:
* Nociceptive Pain: Typically the result of tissue injury. ...
* Inflammatory Pain: An abnormal inflammation caused by an inappropriate response by the body's immune system. ...
* Neuropathic Pain: Pain caused by nerve irritation. ...
* Functional Pain: Pain without obvious origin, but can cause pain.

The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was developed in 1974 by Graham Teasdale and Bryan Jennett, two professors of neurosurgery at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. Their goal was to create a simple and reliable way to assess the level of consciousness in patients with head injuries or neurological conditions.
The GCS measures three key aspects of a patient's response:
1. Eye-opening (E)
2. Verbal response (V)
3. Motor response (M)
Each category is scored independently, and the scores are added together to give a total score ranging from 3 (deep unconsciousness) to 15 (fully alert). The scale is widely used in emergency, intensive care, and trauma settings to assess the severity of brain injuries and monitor a patient's condition over time.
The GCS has since become a global standard in neurological assessment, particularly for assessing traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). It has been praised for its simplicity and consistency, though there have been updates and refinements to its use over time, especially regarding intubated or pediatric patients.
